<h1>How do I spend my time outside of a screen?</h1>
    <h2>Mom</h2>
<p> I am the proud mom of one girl, three boys, and two bougie dogs. 
    Parenting quote I live by is: The best gift you can give your child
    is to give them themselves as soon as possible.  My favorite time with 
    them is at the dinner table, we have the most random conversations.</p>
    

    

<h2>Travel Enthusiast</h2>
    <p>I love to travel.  I would rather spend my money on experiences than
        things.  Traveling takes one out of their comfort zone and teaches one
        to trust; not only in themselves and gut instinct but on the kindness
        of others.  Travel challenges us to question beliefs we have and understand
        more fully the context from which those came.  While teaching us that as 
        many differences we may have, we have many more similarities.

<h2>Avid Pelotoner</h2>
    <p> Introduced to the Peloton in 2018 or so, I never caught the bug until 2021.
        I love the community Peloton offers to people from all walks of life, and all
        corners of the world coming together in a common goal to carve out a small bit
        of our busy day for ourselves.</p>
