                Guided by the idea that it's not about what you tell your children, but how 
                you show them how to live life, we have set out to raise our kids differently
                than we were raised. We're showing them to invest in themselves and invest
                relationships with their partners. We're showing them to see their children
                as the individuals they are and value their views about the world around them.
                One of my favorite times with them is at the dinner table, we have the most random 
                conversations!</p>
