                Guided by the idea that it's not about what you tell your children, but how 
                you show them how to live life, we have set out to raise our kids differently
                than we were raised.  We're showing them to invest in themselves and invest
                relationships with their partners.  We're showing them to see their children
                as the individuals they are and value their views about the world around them.
                One of my favorite times with them is at the dinner table, we have the most random 
                conversations!</p>

                I take every opportunity to see all the world has to offer.
                Travel challenges us to question beliefs we have and understand
                more fully the context from which those came.  While teaching us that as 
                many differences we may have, we have many more similarities.
                I feel like each time you take yourself out of your comfort zone,
                you learn a little more about yourself.  You learn to appreciate
                other cultures, other languages, other viewpoints; an that I believe
                is how we work to work through our differences, recognize our similarities
                and come together!
